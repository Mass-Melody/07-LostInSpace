It acts as a structure jutting from the starboard side of the ship, providing room for landing and loading. \nThe vast port your ship entered through generates a crackling enviro-field, holding in what little toxic atmosphere that remains. \nYou cannot make out any more details due to the dim emergency lighting. \n\n- To the West, you see the bay doors exit.",

An environ-panel hangs open, the oxygen pipe here has been siphoned. \nThe dim red light pervades this area, too, allowing you to barely make out the signage off 3 exits. \nIt seems dumb for everything to be labeled grey, how frustrating. \n\n- To the North, you spot a grey stripe labeled with \"Crew Bays\" leading to the door. \n- To the South, you spot another grey stripe, this one doubled, labeled \"Cargo/Engineering Sector\". \n- To the East, you spot a final grey stripe on the open bay doors, you can vaguely make out the silhouette of your ship in the distance.",
